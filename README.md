<h1>ABChest</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    You choose your language by pressing the language flag and you start pressing letters or numbers on your keyboard and you'll see: 
    <ul>
        <li>the letter/number colored with a random color</li>
        <li>a picture with an object/animal starting with that letter or a picture with a number of objects</li>
        <li>the sound of that letter/number</li>
    </ul>
    <i> 
        This mini game is designed to work for Romanian and English.<br/> 
        Most of the sounds you hear in Romanian are recorded by my little girl.<br/> 
        The sounds in English are recorded by <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/calisto2986">calisto2986</a>.<br/>
