<h1>ABChest</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    You choose your language by pressing the language flag and you start pressing letters or numbers on your keyboard and you'll see: 
    <ul>
        <li>the letter/number colored with a random color</li>
        <li>a picture with an object/animal starting with that letter or a picture with a number of objects</li>
        <li>the sound of that letter/number</li>
    </ul>
    <i> 
        This mini game is designed to work for Romanian and English. 
        Most of the sounds you hear in Romanian are recorded by my little girl. 
        The sounds in English are recorded by <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/calisto2986">calisto2986</a>.
        As far as I remember, all images are from www.pixabay.com and are free to use for commercial and non-commercial use.
